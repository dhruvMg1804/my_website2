<li>Common Stocks and uncommon profits</li>
<li>Margin of Safety</li>
<li>The Dhandho Investor</li>
<li>The Investment Checklist</li>
<li>The Intelligent Investor</li>
<li>Quality of Earnings</li>
<li>Financial Shenanigans</li>
<li>Why stocks go up and down</li>
<li>The compound effect</li>
<li>The 4-hour workweek</li>
<li>The Alchemist</li>
<li>A little history of Religion</li>
<li>The five elements of effective thinking</li>
<li>Shoe Dog</li>
<li>Sapiens</li>
</ol>
