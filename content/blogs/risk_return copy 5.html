<p>Following my Masters in Financial Analysis from LBS, my main goal is to enter the asset management industry and start as an equity investment analyst. Stocks have been one of my passions for a few years now and I want to grow into a better analyst in the coming years. Eventually, I would love to become a portfolio manager and handle money for clients. Afterwards, I would love to go back home in Mauritius and use my experience to open my own fund and provide asset and wealth management services.</p>
<p>“Your ability to success depends on your ability to dream”. This is a quote which has stayed with me for more than 10 years. I believe that I will succeed one day in achieving my dreams and need to work hard towards it.</p>
