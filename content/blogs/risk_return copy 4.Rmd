Food is an essential part of my life. While I'm usually quite disciplined and health-conscious most of the time, I am a different person when I discover new food. I love trying different cuisine and incorporating different techniques and recipes to my own collection of dishes. Since I moved to London in 2016, I have been able to discover different cuisines and have always been open to try as much as possible. My favourite cuisine is most probably Malaysian. Its perfect mixture between Chinese and Indian influence gives unbelievable flavour to the food.
