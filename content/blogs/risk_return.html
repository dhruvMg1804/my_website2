<p>In 1997, I was born in Mauritius, an island country in the Indian Ocean, located off the eastern coast of Africa. It lies about 500 miles (800 km) east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.The island is volcanic in origin and is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. Approximately two-thirds of the population is of Indo-Pakistani origin, one quarter of the population is Creole (of mixed French and African descent), and there are small numbers of people of Chinese and Franco-Mauritian descent. Although English is the official language, it is spoken by a very small percentage of the population. Creole, a French-based patois, is spoken by about four-fifths of the population and is the lingua franca of the country. Bhojpuri, an Indo-Aryan language, is spoken by one-tenth of the population, and French is spoken by a small percentage. Other languages spoken on the island include Hindi, Chinese, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Mauritians commonly speak two, three, or even more languages, and the educational system supports a wide range of language instruction.</p>
<p>Being blessed with such a savage environment and diverse community, I owe my country a lot for the person I am today. I lived there for 19 years before moving to the UK in 2016.</p>
