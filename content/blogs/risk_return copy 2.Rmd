In 2016, I moved to London alone to pursue a degree in economics from University College London. It was the first time that I was living by myself. It was daunting at first but then I got used to how vibrant the city is. The diversity of London also helped my adaptation. However, the cold weather was one, which took the most time to get used to. Being from a tropical island, winter in Mauritius would go as cold as 16 degrees celcius. In contrast, in the UK, I saw snow for the first time.

However, in less than a year, I was already calling London my second home. The diversity of the city was its most attractive aspect. Meeting people from different backgrounds and getting to know different cultures was such an enriching experience. During my 3 years of undergraduate degree, I also explored the UK a bit. I lived in Edinburgh, Scotland for 3 months for work. I also got see the midlands and the south of UK as well. I also enjoyed travelling around Europe, visiting countries such as France, Spain, Portugal, Holland and Belgium.
